# SigScale Global Inc.

SigScale is an open source company focused on software solutions for communications service providers (CSP).

## SigScale OCS
An *Online Charging System* (OCS) performs real-time rating and charging of service usage and prepay balance management. The [ocs](https://github.com/sigscale/ocs) project provides the 3GPP OCS function as well as PCRF (*Policy and Charging Rules Function*) and *3GPP AAA Server* function for *non-3GPP* access authentication.

## SigScale CSE
A *Custom Service Environment*** (CSE) hosts a CSP's custom service logic programs (SLP) in a framework for distributed, massively concurrent execution. The [cse](https://github.com/sigscale/cse) project enables vustom SLPs with protocols stacks for CAMEL, INAP, DIAMETER, RADIUS and REST Open APIs. Complete SLPs are provided for prepaid charging of CS, PS, IMS, SMS, MMS with an external OCS.
