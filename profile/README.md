## About
SigScale is an open source company focused on software solutions for communications service providers (CSP). Our RTU license free solutions are backed by commercial subscription support services.

## Solutions
Our solutions are used by CSPs and vendors for key network functions in service delivery and revenue management.

### SigScale OCS
An *Online Charging System* (OCS) performs real-time rating and charging of service usage and prepay balance management. The [ocs](https://github.com/sigscale/ocs) project provides the 3GPP OCS function as well as PCRF (*Policy and Charging Rules Function*) and *3GPP AAA Server* function for *non-3GPP* access authentication.

#### SigScale CSE
A *Custom Service Environment* (CSE) hosts a CSP's custom service logic programs (SLP) in a framework for distributed, massively concurrent execution. The [cse](https://github.com/sigscale/cse) project enables custom SLPs with protocol stacks for CAMEL, INAP, DIAMETER, RADIUS and REST Open APIs. Complete SLPs are provided for prepaid charging of CS, PS, IMS, SMS, MMS with an external OCS.
 
## Protocol Stacks
SigScale software solutions are developed in the Erlang programming language for the OTP runtime environment. Our protocol stack application and CODEC library projects include [m3ua](https://github.com/sigscale/m3ua), [sccp](https://github.com/sigscale/sccp), [tcap](https://github.com/sigscale/tcap), [map](https://github.com/sigscale/map), [cap](https://github.com/sigscale/cse), [inap](https://github.com/sigscale/inap), [radius](https://github.com/sigscale/radierl) and [ngap](https://github.com/sigscale/5g-ngap).
